# Description
I will be using what I've learned in react to develop the initial scaffolding of my portfolio site from scratch using React. Now that I've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for my first portfolio site, as well as create or update other materials so that I can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.
